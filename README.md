## Contents
This week has several examples located in the [./examples](./examples) directory. Make sure you have Rust installed and you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza).

This repository is *Codespaces ready*, and it is set as a template repository. You can create a new repository from this template and start working on your own with Codespaces. This means that Rust, Copilot, and all the extensions are already installed and configured for you.

### Lesson 1: Introduction to System Automation
- [](./examples/)

### Lesson 2: Running external programs
- [](./examples/)

### Lesson 3: Building System utilities
- [](./examples/)


### Lesson 4: Practice Lab
Use the [included practice lab](./lab.md) to apply the content you've learned in this week. Follow the steps to create your own repository and apply the requirements to complete the lab.
